# GRBL ESP32 Project Context

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: GRBL ESP32 CNC Controller Testing
- **Date Started**: October 28, 2025
- **Previous Context**: Migrated from stirringbioreactor project - lost chat context during transition

## Current Objectives
- Testing GRBL ports on ESP32
- Configuring machine-specific pin mappings
- Validating communication and control functionality

## Hardware Setup
- ESP32 Development Board: [TO BE SPECIFIED]
- Machine Configuration: [TO BE SPECIFIED]
- Connected Peripherals: [TO BE SPECIFIED]

## Testing Status
- [ ] Basic ESP32 communication test
- [ ] Port configuration validation
- [ ] Motor control testing
- [ ] Limit switch functionality
- [ ] Serial communication verification

## Notes
- Need to determine specific machine configuration file being used
- Previous work on stirringbioreactor was using Git successfully
- Lost context during project switch - implementing Git tracking to prevent future loss

## Next Steps
1. Determine current hardware setup
2. Identify appropriate machine configuration
3. Test basic functionality
4. Document any issues or modifications needed
